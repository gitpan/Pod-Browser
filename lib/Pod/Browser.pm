=head1 NAME

Pod::Browser - Pod Web Server based on Catalyst and ExtJS

=head1 VERSION

version 1.0.0

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # pod_browser

  visit http://localhost:3030

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a L<Catalyst> server which serves PODs. It allows you to browse through your local
repository of modules. On the front page is a search box
which uses CPAN's xml interface to retrieve the results. If you click on one of them
the POD is displayed in this application.

Cross links in PODs are resolved and pop up as a new tab. If the module you clicked on is
not installed this controller fetches the source code from CPAN and creates the pod locally.
There is also a TOC which is always visible and scrolls the current POD to the selected section.

It is written using a JavaScript framework called ExtJS (L<http://www.extjs.com>) which
generates beautiful and rich user interfaces.
